Hi everyone, my name is Praver Kumar Mishra and I'm new to the world of programming! I'm excited to learn and grow my skills on GitHub, and I'm open to any guidance and advice that the community has to offer.

I'm currently studying in first year of my four years long under grad degree from IIT Madras in Data Science and have a strong interest in Blockchain, Metaverse, WEB3, AI, ML. I'm looking forward to contributing to open source projects and learning from the community.

Currently, I'm focusing on learning C, C++, Python and Data Structures and Algorithms and have completed a few online courses to get started. I'm also working on some personal projects, which I hope to share on my profile soon.

I'm looking forward to connecting with other newbies and experienced developers alike, and I'm always open to collaboration and feedback. Thanks for stopping by my profile!
